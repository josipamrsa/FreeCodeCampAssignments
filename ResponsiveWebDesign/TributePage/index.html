                <h2>SQL history</h2>
                <p>The SQL programming language was first developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers 
                Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The programming language, known then as SEQUEL, 
                was created following the publishing of Edgar Frank Todd's paper, "A Relational Model 
                of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," in 1970.
